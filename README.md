# UrbanMagnetometer
This project records magnetic field data from a BioMed fluxgate sensor, puts GPS-disciplined timestamps on it,
and uploads it to the Google Drive for further processing.

# Getting started

## System requirements

## Hardware

## Obtaining Google authorization credentials

## Deploying magnetometers

## Powering Biomed magnetometer with a battery pack

## Using Data Grabber

## Using Sample Grabber

# Technical documantation

  * DataGrabber -- logs the data continuously for long periods of time
  * SampleGrabber -- records short magnetic data samples
  * GDriveFolderMerge -- merges folders with the same name in Google drive folder (should they appear)
  * Utils -- library containting the logic
